            <div class="question">What is an accordion?</div>

            <div class="answer">An accordion is a user interface component commonly used to display 
                collapsible content sections. It allows users to expand or collapse sections of content, 
                providing a compact way to present information while preserving screen space. The name 
                "accordion" is derived from the musical instrument, as the expanding and collapsing sections
                 resemble the bellows of an accordion.

                Typically, an accordion consists of a series of vertically stacked panels, where each panel 
                represents a section of content. One panel is usually expanded and visible at a time, while 
                the other panels are collapsed and hidden. Users can interact with the accordion by clicking 
                on the panel headers to expand or collapse the corresponding content section.

        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question">What are the benefits of using an accordion?</div>

            <div class="answer">Space efficiency: Accordions save space on a webpage by displaying only one 
                panel's content at a time, allowing users to focus on relevant information.

                Organization and hierarchy: Accordions help organize content into logical sections, making 
                it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need.
                
                Interactivity and user control: Users have control over which sections they want to expand 
                or collapse, allowing them to customize their viewing experience and focus on the content 
                they find most relevant.
                
                Accordions are commonly used in various contexts, such as FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions),
                 product descriptions, content-heavy websites, and more. They provide an intuitive way to 
                 present large amounts of information in a compact and user-friendly manner.

        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question">Can I have multiple panels open at the same time in an accordion?</div>

            <div class="answer">By default, accordions display only one panel at a time, with the rest 
                collapsed. However, you can customize the behavior to allow multiple panels to be open 
                simultaneously if desired. This involves modifying the JavaScript code that controls the 
                accordion's behavior. Depending on the implementation or the framework used, there may be 
                specific options or configurations available to enable multi-panel expansion.

        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question">Are accordions accessible and SEO-friendly?</div>

            <div class="answer">Accordions can be made accessible and SEO-friendly by ensuring proper HTML 
                structure, using appropriate ARIA roles and attributes, and handling keyboard navigation 
                and focus management. It's important to ensure that screen readers can understand the 
                content and that users can navigate through the accordion using keyboard controls. 
                Additionally, search engines can index the content within the accordion panels if the HTML 
                is structured correctly, making it SEO-friendly.
